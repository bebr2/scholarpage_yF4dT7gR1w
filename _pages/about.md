<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently studying at the School of Computer Science, Ocean University of China (OUC), where my supervisor is [Gao Feng](https://kmrvyozrlx.k.topthink.com/@oucaigroup/fenggao.html), and I am part of the [OUC AI Group](https://kmrvyozrlx.k.topthink.com/@oucaigroup/readme.html).

My research interests encompass a diverse and interdisciplinary range of topics, including data-driven ocean prediction, computer vision, video generation, and diffusion models. I have published some papers with total google scholar citations <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zk2uLXoAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
